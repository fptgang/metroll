We are Metro - a metro ticketing system written in Java Spring Boot Cloud

The project has following core components
- The Config Server: using Spring Cloud Config Server as the centralized store of configuration of all services within the project
- The Service Registry: using Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka as the centralized service registry
- The API Gateway: put in front of services, responsible for routing and authorization

And there are other business feature services.

Ensure the code goes into the right module:
- account-service
- ticket-service
- subway-service
- order-service
- api-gateway
- service-registry
- config-server

The "shared" module is used for business feature services (all modules suffixing -service except the 3 core components) contains shared DTOs, Domain, Utilities, etc

All services including the Service Registry and API Gateway has their configuration files served by the Config Server

The expected running environment is containerization with three core components having fixed domain name and ports (Config Server, Service Registry, API Gateway) while the rest having randomly-assigned domain name and port by Docker environment. Only the port 8080 binded by the API Gateway is exposed to the host

For example, a request from the host: `http://localhost:8080/account/{path}` will be routed to account-service at `http:/{account-service-address-provided-by-Eureka}/{path}`

The build.gradle at the project root contains most of dependency declaration. Only module-specific dependency is declared in the respective build.gradle
